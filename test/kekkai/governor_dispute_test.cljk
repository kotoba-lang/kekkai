  "Dispute-resolution contract for :witness/dispute (ADR-2607110300 Phase
  4): there is deliberately no automated resolution anywhere in this
  system -- disputes ALWAYS escalate to a human, unconditionally, even
  with a maximally-clean proposal. Confidence is irrelevant to this op:
  unlike :access/assess (which can auto-commit when clean and confident),
  :witness/dispute has no path to :ok? at all.

  Scoped to `governor/check`/`hold-fact` directly (unit-level), same
  scope discipline as governor_treasury_test.clj -- full StateGraph
  wiring is a further integration step, not done in this session."
