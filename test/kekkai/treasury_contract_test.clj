  "End-to-end :treasury/release through the full CoordinationActor
  StateGraph (ADR-2607110300 Phase 3, completing the 'further integration
  step' both kekkai#2 and kekkai#3 left as a scope note) -- parity with
  governor_contract_test.clj's :node/admit-style contract tests, not just
  the governor.cljc-level unit tests in governor_treasury_test.clj. Proves
  three things unit tests on governor/check alone cannot: (1) the
  StateGraph actually reaches :interrupted for a clean proposal (2) the
  hold-fact for a rejected verdict actually lands in the ledger through
  the :hold node's :t filter (3) :treasury/release is NOT gated by the
  tailnet rollout phase, unlike :node/admit."
