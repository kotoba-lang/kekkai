  "Value-governance contract for :treasury/release (ADR-2607110300 Phase 3):
  widens TailnetGovernor's remit from network reachability to fund release,
  gated on a witness-quorum verdict instead of an ACL grant. Deny-by-default:
  no verdict, or a non-:witnessed verdict, is a hard (unoverridable)
  violation -- exactly like an unbacked reachability edge under
  :access/assess.

  Scoped to `governor/check`/`hold-fact` directly (unit-level), not the full
  operation.cljc StateGraph/coordllm Advisor -- wiring :treasury/release
  through request->record/commit-effects! and a :treasury store :kind is a
  further integration step, not done in this session (see this PR's
  description)."
