  "Punitive-value-governance contract for :availability/slash: mirrors
  governor_treasury_test.clj's shape exactly, but gates a slashing action on
  a caller-supplied retrieval-availability verdict (kotoba-lang/
  kotobase-peer's availability.cljc `audit-outcome` --
  `{:kotobase.availability/node ... :kotobase.availability/cid ...
  :kotobase.availability/epoch ... :kotobase.availability/verdict v}`)
  instead of a witness-quorum verdict. Deny-by-default: no verdict, or a
  verdict whose :kotobase.availability/verdict is not :failed/:missed
  (i.e. :ok, :malformed, or :verifier-lacks-replica -- inconclusive
  outcomes), is a hard (unoverridable) violation -- exactly like a
  non-:witnessed witness-verdict is under :treasury/release.

  Scoped to `governor/check`/`hold-fact` directly (unit-level), same scope
  discipline as governor_treasury_test.clj/governor_dispute_test.clj --
  full StateGraph wiring is a further integration step, not done in this
