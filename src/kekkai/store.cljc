(ns kekkai.store
  "SSoT for the kekkai tailnet control plane, behind a `Store` protocol so the
  backend is a swap (MemStore default ‖ DatomicStore via langchain.db, itself
  swappable to real Datomic Local / kotoba-server).

  Domain = a zero-trust mesh overlay (a Tailscale-equivalent control plane).
  The actor is the COORDINATION/CONTROL plane only — it publishes a netmap
  (who-can-reach-whom); the WireGuard data plane lives in the nodes, which pull
  the netmap and open their own tunnels. The actor never carries packets.

    tailnet  — ONE ORGANIZATION's isolated overlay: id (e.g. \"gftd/root\"),
               org, name, status. The org boundary is a first-class entity
               rather than a naming convention inside the ACL, because a
               convention inside the ACL is one a grant can talk its way past.
    node     — a machine in a tailnet: did (node key did:key), user (owner),
               tailnet, tags, os, key-expiry (epoch s), status (pending/
               authorized/expired/revoked). A node IS its key (Tailscale
               node-key model).
    user     — a tailnet member (login, role, tailnet)
    policy   — the ACL, ONE PER TAILNET: tag-owners {tag [users]} +
               deny-by-default grants
               [{:src [tag|user] :dst [tag|user] :ports [int|\"*\"]}]
    peering  — the only way an edge crosses two tailnets: a record naming both,
               carrying its own directional grants, valid only once BOTH orgs
               approved it (kekkai.acl/peering-active?)
    route    — a subnet/exit route a node advertises (cidr, kind, approved?)
    heartbeat— digital-twin liveness events (last-seen epoch s, endpoint)
    netmap   — the committed access assessment for a node (reachable peers)

  Tenancy is a property of the *plane*, not of a deployment: one kekkai
  control plane serves many organizations, and `plane` projects the pure
  {:policies :peerings} data that kekkai.acl decides over.

  Charter: integers, not floats (epoch seconds, ports); EAVT ground datoms are
  canonical; the append-only **ledger is the tailnet's membership & access
  genealogy** — an immutable zero-trust audit trail (who joined, who could
  reach whom, on whose authority, when keys rotated), the property a mutable
  admin console can't give you. There is intentionally **no :traffic/* or
  :user/activity namespace** — the control plane authorizes reachability, it
  never logs what flows through the tunnels (anti-surveillance, Wellbecoming
  §1.13)."

  Built from the published policies, NOT by walking registered tailnets: a

  and not in another's from the same publish.

  `relays` and `version` are the caller's. Relays are still deployment

  "Two organizations on ONE control plane.

  `default` is alice's original tailnet: n-pending is a clean device awaiting
  machine approval; n-rogue (mallory) claims a tag it doesn't own AND has an
  expired key → the TailnetGovernor must hold its admission, un-overridably.

  `acme` is a second organization that independently named a tag `tag:server`
  and independently uses `10.0.0.0/24` — both collisions are what happens by
  default, not contrivances (RFC1918 space and obvious tag names are finite).
  Under one flat policy, alice's `tag:laptop → tag:server` grant would have
  matched acme's server, and acme's approved 10.0.0.0/24 would have blocked
  alice's identical subnet as a 'hijack'. The tenant plane exists so neither
  happens, and the demo carries the collisions so a regression shows up here."
