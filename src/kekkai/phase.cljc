  "Phase 0→3 staged rollout, gating only the ASSESS ops (netmap/admission/route
  decisions). Recording tailnet ground datoms (register a node, log a heartbeat,
  publish ACL, advertise a route) is always on — that is kekkai's observe
  charter (durable EAVT facts). The phase only decides how much autonomy the
  *control-plane decisions* have, and can only add caution.

    0 observe-only  — record join requests / heartbeats / ACL / advertised
                      routes; emit NO netmap decisions yet (shadow tailnet).
    1 assisted      — access netmaps allowed, but always human for admission.
    2 assisted-net  — access + subnet-route decisions may auto-commit when
                      clean; node admission and exit nodes stay human.
    3 supervised    — access/subnet auto-commit when clean+confident; node
                      admission and exit-node approval are high-stakes and
                      ALWAYS route to a human admin (machine approval is a human
                      call, like Tailscale).

  Value governance (:treasury/release, ADR-2607110300 Phase 3) is active at
  every phase above, including 0 -- it never auto-commits regardless of
  phase (always high-stakes, see governor.cljc), so there is no rollout
  ladder for it to climb; gating it behind the NETWORK phase would just be
  wrong (fund release has nothing to do with tailnet maturity).")

;; ADR-2607110300 Phase 3: value governance (fund release) is orthogonal to
;; the tailnet rollout ladder below -- a system can govern fund release
;; before it trusts automated NETWORK decisions, so :treasury/release is
;; active in :assess at every phase, including 0. :witness/dispute (Phase 4)
;; is deliberately NOT here: this governor has no automated
;; dispute-resolution shape (see governor.cljc's
;; dispute-actuation-violations docstring -- there is no
;; "dispute-resolved-in-favor-of-X" verdict) to route through :decide/:commit,
;; so it stays reachable via governor/check + hold-fact directly, not this
;; StateGraph, until dispute-resolution semantics are actually designed.
