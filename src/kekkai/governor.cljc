  "TailnetGovernor — the independent zero-trust layer that earns the coord-LLM
  the right to *propose* netmaps. The LLM has no notion of node-key validity,
  deny-by-default ACLs, tag ownership or the no-actuation charter, so this MUST
  be a separate system (rules over the EAVT ground datoms) able to *reject* a
  proposal and fall back to HOLD — the kekkai analog of robotaxi's MRC /
  itonami's cert hold.

  The actor is **coordinate → publish-netmap only**. It never pushes WireGuard
  config to a node and never carries a packet; admitting a machine into the
  tailnet is ALWAYS routed to a human admin (the Tailscale 'machine approval'
  toggle), and so is approving an exit node. Below, HARD invariants force HOLD
  (a human cannot approve past an unowned tag, an expired/revoked key, an
  un-permitted reachability edge, or a route hijack); a clean admission/exit
  still routes to a human (high-stakes).

  HARD invariants:
    :node/admit
      1. Valid node key   — node presents a did:key, status ≠ revoked, key not
                            expired (key-expiry > now).
      2. Tag ownership     — every tag the node claims is authorized for its
                            owner by the policy's tag-owners (no self-escalation).
      3. No-actuation      — effect must be :netmap (a control-plane record),
                            never a data-plane / WireGuard push.
    :access/assess
      1. Valid node key on the subject AND every proposed peer.
      2. Deny-by-default   — every proposed reachability edge is backed by an
                            ACL grant; an unbacked edge is rejected.
      3. No-actuation.
    :route/approve
      1. Valid node key on the advertising node.
      2. No-hijack         — the cidr is not already approved for a DIFFERENT
                            node (no silent route takeover).
      3. No-actuation.
    :treasury/release (ADR-2607110300 Phase 3 -- widens this governor's remit
                       from network reachability to value: same deny-by-
                       default philosophy as acl.cljc's edge-allowed?, now
                       gating fund release on a witness-quorum verdict
                       instead of an ACL grant)
      1. Valid node key   — same identity check as every other op; the
                            requesting actor must be a live, non-revoked,
                            non-expired node (an actor has its own did:key,
                            per the CLAUDE.md Actor pattern).
      2. Witness quorum    — deny-by-default for value: an absent or
                            non-:witnessed witness-quorum verdict
                            (kotoba.lang.witness-quorum's :kind, injected via
                            the proposal, never vendored here) is a hard
                            violation, exactly like an unbacked reachability
                            edge is under :access/assess.
      3. No-actuation      — effect must be :treasury-release (a record for a
                            separate settlement step to read and execute);
                            this governor never moves funds itself.
    :witness/dispute (ADR-2607110300 Phase 4 -- a contested slashing
                      verdict; there is no automated dispute-resolution
                      algorithm anywhere in this system, deliberately: per
                      the ADR's own alternatives-considered section,
                      designing dispute economics against a hypothetical
                      counterparty is not verifiable today. This op
                      therefore has exactly one behavior: record the
                      dispute and ALWAYS escalate, unconditionally — never
                      auto-resolves, regardless of confidence or how clean
                      the proposal looks)
      1. Valid node key   — the disputing actor must itself be a live,
                            non-revoked, non-expired node.
      2. No-actuation      — effect must be :dispute-record (a record for
                            a human to read and decide); this governor
                            never resolves a dispute itself.
  SOFT:
    4. Confidence floor → escalate.
    5. Node admission, exit-route approval, treasury release, AND witness
       disputes are all high-stakes → ALWAYS human. Disputes go further
       than the other three: confidence is irrelevant, there is no path
       to :ok? at all for this op."
