  "CoordinationActor — one tailnet control-plane operation = one supervised
  actor run, a langgraph-clj StateGraph. Two flows share one auditable graph:

    ingest (record-op):  intake → record → END
        node/heartbeat/user/acl/route become durable EAVT ground datoms. This
        is the observe charter; always on, never an LLM call, never a data-plane
        push.

    assess (assess-op):  intake → advise → govern → decide → commit|hold|approval
        the coord-LLM (sealed) proposes an admission / netmap / route decision;
        the TailnetGovernor enforces zero-trust invariants (node-key validity,
        deny-by-default ACL, tag ownership, no route hijack, no actuation); the
        phase gate adds caution; admitting a machine or approving an exit node
        ALWAYS routes to a human admin (interrupt-before :request-approval).

  Single invariant (the kekkai analog of robotaxi's safety contract):
    the actor never installs a reachability edge / admits a device / approves a
    route the TailnetGovernor would reject, and never actuates the data plane
    (it publishes a netmap; the nodes open their own WireGuard tunnels)."
